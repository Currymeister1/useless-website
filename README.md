# useless-website

Just a website to play with some APIs and Vue.js. There are two views: one for the weather and other one for the public transport timing.  

## To launch this webapp
1. Go into the frontend directory and run this command: ` npm run serve`. 
2. Go into the backend directory and run this command: `node App.js`.
